# Note

A simple routing practice.

### 1. Used the library react-router-dom. 

### 2. Used three objects - Switch, Link, Route in the library.

### 3. Route render methods
There are 3 ways to render something with a <Route>:
1. ```<Route component>```
2. ```<Route render>```
3. ```<Route children>```
Each is useful in different circumstances. You should use only one of these props on a given <Route>. See their explanations below to understand why you have 3 options. Most of the time youâ€™ll use component.
 
### 4. Route props
All three render methods will be passed the same three route props
1. match
2. location
3. history

### 5. Learnt the difference between functional and class components.
