# Note

A simple routing practice 

## Used the library react-router-dom. 
## Used Switch, Link, Route object in the library.

## Route render methods
There are 3 ways to render something with a <Route>:
1. ```<Route component>```
2. ```<Route render>```
3. ```<Route children>```
Each is useful in different circumstances. You should use only one of these props on a given <Route>. See their explanations below to understand why you have 3 options. Most of the time youâ€™ll use component.
 
## Route props
All three render methods will be passed the same three route props
1. match
2. location
3. history

### Got to know the difference between functional and class components.
